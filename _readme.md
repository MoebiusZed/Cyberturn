# Introduction

This is a Unreal Engine template for 5.1 or greater.

The template was made by **Rian Rutherford** _(rr262471)_. To make the template, I used the pervious UE4 template as a starting point.

`Documentation`, `DevelopmentAssets`, and `Game/RawContent` are optional folders, these can be deleted if you don't want them.

If you want you can rename the `Game` folder to something else. What is important is to make sure whatever the folder name, it has the `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` file inside.

If you are a programmer and using this template for the first time, you need to read the [project root readme](Game/readme.md). It has useful information that you should check.
